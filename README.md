# WebScraping

This is a very simple use of the SwiftSoup library that just returns the 
plain text from a web page. Extend this as-needed to process headers,
lists, etc. using the [documentation](https://github.com/scinfu/SwiftSoup).

The second unit test function **testToShowSwiftSoupStructureExamples**
also shows examples of accessing the structure of a web page.

Note that the first time that you do a

    swift build
    swift test

you will see warning from the SwiftSoup library that you can ignore.
